## Configure cronjob:
- The cronjobs are scheduled to run every 15 mins, which is configurable. Change the schedule to run the cronjobs at: 
```
https://github.com/ibm-cloud-security/security-advisor-k8s-bench-integration/blob/master/config/helm/kubebench-adapter-public/templates/kube-cronjob.yaml#L8
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you get an error something like `Error: incompatible versions client and server`, run `helm init --upgrade`
2. If you get an error like : `namespaces security-advisor-insights is forbidden: User system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default cannot get resource namespaces in API group in thenamespace security-advisor-insights`, fix the helm using [helm setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-integrations#helm) or follow below steps:
   ```kubectl delete deployment tiller-deploy -n kube-system
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/rbac/serviceaccount-tiller.yaml
   helm init --service-account tiller
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=helm
   helm list
   ```
